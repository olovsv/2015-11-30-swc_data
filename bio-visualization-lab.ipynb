    "We will be working with real [gene expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) data obtained by [Cap Analysis of Gene Expression(CAGE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_analysis_gene_expression) from human samples by the [FANTOM5](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/) consortium. We will be following a typical workflow of a bioinformatician exploring new data, looking for the outliers: interesting genes or samples, or general patterns in the data. "

    "For creating a small data subset we can work with in this tutorial, I used [TET: Fantom 5 Table Extraction tool](http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/tet). I picked a few human samples, mostly brain tissues with a few outliers, like uterus and downloaded a tab-separated file from the website. For more advanced data extraction, it's good to have a look at [TET's API](https://github.com/Hypercubed/TET/blob/master/README.md). \n",
    "I have picked normalized tpm(tags per million) and annotated data, so we can focus only on processed data for protein coding genes. All data files for this notebook are available on figshare: http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1430029"
