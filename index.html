<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.
</p>
<p align="center">

  <a href="#setup">below</a>). They are also required to abide by
  Software Carpentry's
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
  We require that all participants sign up for a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a>
  and to <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html">configure Git</a> on your laptop
  before the course starts
  and we ask the participants to get familiar with Git by reading <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">Version Control with Git</a>
  and practicing with basic Git challenges on <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">https://try.github.io</a>.
  We will offer a short recap on Git basics during the first day of the course.

  <h3>Day 3</h3>
  <p>
  To get academic credits for the course or just feel like you accomplished
  something, we recommend attending a seminar on day 3 where you can get your
  exercises solutions accepted and discuss any questions you have with the
  instructors.
  </p>

  <p>
  These workshops are registered as PhD level courses at Stockholm University:

  <ul>
    <li>Software carpentry for beginners 1,5 hp</li>
    <li>Data carpentry and machine learning 1,5 hp</li>
  </ul>

  Getting the course certificates requires completing all the workshop assignments.

<!--
  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://pad.software-carpentry.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
  e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

{% if page.etherpad %}

  <strong>Etherpad:</strong> <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">{{page.etherpad}}</a>.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="editor"> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words. Editors that you could use if you have not chosen one already are:
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <table class="table">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <tr>
            <td align="center"><a href="https://atom.io/"><img height="150" width="150", src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Atom_editor_logo.svg/2000px-Atom_editor_logo.svg.png"/></a></td>

        </tr>

    </table>
  </div>
</div> <!-- End of 'editor' section. -->

<div id="python"> <!-- Start of 'Python' section. Remove the third paragraph if
           the workshop will teach Python using something other than
           the IPython notebook.
           Details at http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility -->
  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
                We will teach Python using the <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>,
                a programming environment that runs in a web browser. We will be occasionally using
                <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/ipython-interactive-demo-7.21492?article=1.16261#">Nature's (Rackspace) JupyterHub</a>
                and <a href="http://mybinder.org/">mybinder.org</a> for some of the lessons.
    </p>

  <p>
  Once you are done installing the software listed above,
  please go to <a href="setup/index.html">this page</a>,
  which has instructions on how to test that everything was installed correctly.
  Please also verify that you have correctly
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html">configured Git</a> on your laptop
  before the beginning of the course.
  </p>

<!--
  Uncomment this section if you are using our virtual machine.

<div id="vm">
  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>

  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
